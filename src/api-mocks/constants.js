The rotation may also involve growing forage crops in rotation with other field crops. Crop rotations vary with soil type, crops produced, farming operations, and how the crop residue is managed. The most effective crops for soil improvement are fibrous-rooted high-residue producing crops such as grass and small grain. Perennial plants used for forage are very effective in crop rotations due to increases in organic matter and reduced soil erosion. In addition, crop rotations help break insect, disease, and weed cycles. Rotations add diversity to farm operations and often reduce economic and environmental risks.',

Cover crops have a filtering effect on movement of sediment, pathogens, and dissolved and sediment-attached pollutants.

    projectDescription:
      'Traditional bird or amphibian surveys typically require one or more observers in the field to document birds by sight or vocalization. A number of factors associated with different methods can result in negative impact to a species and poor monitoring results. With acoustic monitoring a species can be monitored for days or weeks with disturbance limited to brief visits to the site to set up and retrieve the recordings. The data are collected at all sites in the same way removing all observer bias or influences of inclement weather. The potential bias associated with data analysis is eliminated because recordings are scanned on a computer with the same recognizer. This technology has proven to be extremely effective for determination of presence or absence of specific wildlife species (bats and marine mammals) without the intrusion or influence of humans in the area. This project will utilize the technology of acoustic monitoring by developing, testing and refining recognizers to improve monitoring of threatened and endangered species in the San Luis Valley. Acoustic monitors will be deployed to detect breeding populations, focus Habitat improvement measures and measure success of treatments by the presence or absence of these species in locations that have baseline conditions documented through matching funds.',

It is this systems-based and context-dependent approach to soil health, in concert with social support, that can transcend the limitations of isolated conservation practices and decision making. To increase the adoption of soil health management systems in the High Plains, we will demonstrate that producers can implement these systems profitably. An emphasis on applying principle-based systems rather than specific practices will permit us to work with a diverse cohort of 6 long-term practitioners of soil health and 18 transitioning producers representing both dryland and irrigated operations. Producers will receive financial support to create Comprehensive Soil Health Management Plans and implement a suite of practices well-suited for their operation. FARMS: Farmers for Advancing Regenerative Management Systems will provide qualified technical assistance, facilitate peer working groups, and leverage the expertise of long-term practitioners to mentor transitioning producers.

The Colorado Department of Agriculture Insectary has been at the forefront of a number of weed biological control projects. The Insectary currently has in culture, or in field insectaries, 24 arthropods used in weed biocontrol. Among our target weeds are several species that are widespread and can have severe economic and environmental impacts. Proven and effective biocontrol agents for control of these weeds are available at the Insectary. A major challenge is to get the control agents out to the areas where they are needed and to monitor weed infestations to assure establishment of the agents and actual control of the weeds. The purpose of this project is to use biocontrol to manage multi-species weed invasions on a large tract of tribal land. The project will execute a novel multi-species control plan using proven biocontrol technology. The outcome of this effort will be a template for future programs that target a number of weed pest species and bring together agencies and groups to control weeds on private and public lands.',
