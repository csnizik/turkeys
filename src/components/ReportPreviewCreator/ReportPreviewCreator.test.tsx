          projectDescription:
            'North Jersey RC&D (NJRCD) proposes a soil health demonstration that compares typical\nnortheastern US cover crop termination practice (termination in early to mid- spring, using\nherbicide, weeks before planting) against innovative methods of delaying cover crop termination\nand cash crop planting. These innovative methods include planting into (1) a green living cover\ncrop, (2) a mature cover crop terminated using a roller crimper and (3) a cover crop intensively\ngrazed by livestock. These strategies maximize soil cover, biodiversity, and the presence of\nliving roots in annual crop systems, ultimately increasing the agronomic and economic value of\ncover crop to agricultural producers.\nUsing a paired study design, three treatments (aforementioned cover crop termination methods)\nwill be compared against a control (existing termination practices) on 25 farms (4000 acres total\nof northern New Jersey cropland). Using a combination of soil samples and field assessments,\nfarm data, and farmer interviews, NJRCD and partners will compare environmental, economic,\nand social impacts of treatments. By identifying, documenting, and evaluating regionally\nsuccessful cover crop termination approaches, this proposal will help farmers realize the full\nbenefits of Cover Crops thereby stimulating additional soil health system adoption.',

On- farm demonstration sites and comparison studies will be established in eastern Colorado, western Kansas and western Nebraska to show farmers how these management practices can be successfully adopted in these environments.',
