  'These initiatives enhance the locally driven process for identifying conservation priorities to better address nationally and regionally important conservation goals that transcend localities.  They build on locally led efforts and partnerships, and they’re based on science. Through the initiatives, NRCS and its partners coordinate the delivery of assistance where it can have the most impact. These landscape-level efforts have seen success across the country. From the removal of streams from the federal impaired streams list to the determination not to list the greater sage-grouse and New England cottontail, NRCS’ work with producers benefits wildlife, natural resources and agricultural operations across the country.';
