These activities are implemented through EQIP and CTA, consistent with the Agricultural Act of 2018, implementing regulations, and NRCS policy for CTA, EQIP, and conservation program contracting. Each year’s IA includes specific objectives and requirements for obligation and expenditure of funds that must be followed in addition to statutes and regulations and NRCS policy.\r',

      'The purpose of MRBI is to improve water quality and assist States in implementing their nutrient reduction strategies associated with the Hypoxia Task Force Action Plan. NRCS designates MRBI focus area watersheds (HUC 8) that align with each State’s priorities for nutrient reduction. These focus watersheds typically represent those that contribute the greatest nutrient loads, due to agricultural sources, to the Gulf of Mexico. MRBI efforts are targeted to small priority watersheds within these larger focus watersheds. The initiative provides assistance through the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) as described in this guidance. There is also a Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) component of MRBI.\r',

These implementation plans are developed by State conservationists (STCs) in cooperation with their State and local partners. Implementation plans document annual targets for conservation treatments and must be informed by watershed assessments that identify critical source areas related to nutrient and sediment loss. Implementation plans must also contain quantifiable interim metrics for each watershed related to the primary water quality concerns that can be reported annually.  These metrics are in addition to a common metric for all MRBI watersheds that captures progress in treating critical source areas.\r',
